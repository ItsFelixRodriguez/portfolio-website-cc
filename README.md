# portfolio-website-cc

This project is an attempt to build a personal portfolio website to showcase my work as an aspiring web developer. I plan to eventually use a custom domain registration to make a website redirect to the website in order for it to actually be a real portfolio. 

## Objectives:

+ Build the website using HTML and CSS.
+ Add at least one interactive feature using Javascript/DOM
+ Use Git version control
+ Develop Locally on the computer
+ Deploy using Github Pages
+ Buy a custom Domain name and have it point to my Github Pages website.

### Lessons learned and things to change:

The webpage is complete after 3 days of revisions. The biggest challenge for me was implementing the Javascript from a previous project but adding DOM manipulation to it. After a day of reviewing the lessons on offer at Codecademy I eventually realized I was making a syntax error when trying to reference the element in my JS page. 

Overall this is looking like one of my better projects I have put together even if I did succumb to scope creep once or twice.

The website is live! It still needs to be formatted to look better on mobile but
